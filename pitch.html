	<b><u>Pitch #1</b></u>
	<br>
	I commute to school every day from Washington Heights, all the way at the top of Manhattan. From 181st street until 125th street, I am often treated to an enthusiastic mariachi performance. 125th until 59th is break dance territory, where techno blasts from boom boxes and teenagers leap into the air for pocket change. From 59th all the way down to the Lower East Side, acoustic guitarists, solo singers and other talented (or less talented) folk enter the subway car, perform, ask for my pocket change and move on to bring their music back Uptown. 
	<br><br>
	I propose an interactive subway map that highlights the most musical stops in Manhattan, color-coded by genre and peppered with interviews with long-standing performers. This map would take major stops along a well-travelled line (perhaps the A train or the 1 train) and instantly show what sort of musical street performance you are most likely to encounter, and also allow an overarching comparison of musical performances up and down Manhattan. 
	<br><br>
	Official data sources are unlikely, but human sources abound. Boots on the ground reporting and interviews with subway workers could help develop a general impression, and interviewing performers and commuters could also paint a fairly accurate picture of what music to expect on your commute. Ultimately I would need data to crunch, which could be tricky to find. With data sets, I could pitch the story to a publication like the New York Times. Without data sets (with only interviews and subjective analyses) I could pitch the story to a less rigorous magazine.

		<b><u>Pitch #2</b></u>
		<br>
		At Popular Mechanics, I have learned not to pitch stories about women's issues, pure biology or liberals. Turns out that their target audience is a 35-year-old conservative male techie, and that it makes no sense to print stories that wont appeal to that demographic. 
		<br><br>
		Magazines generally have a target audience, with well-defined ages, genders, occupations and marital status. I propose an infographic taking the top 20 most read magazines and visualizing their target audiences. I don't think that target audience is a proprietary secret, so data collection would be a fairly straightforward matter of calling each magazine in question. I would sort the data by gender, age, occupation and marital status, and present a static view of who reads what. 
		<br><br> 
		I could probably pitch this to just about any magazine that isn't on the list. If the story revealed any surprising trends, like 99 percent of magazines have the exact same target audience, that might develop into an interesting text story to accompany a surprisingly skewed graph. In that case, I might pitch it to a place like ProPublica.
