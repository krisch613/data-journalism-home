	<b><u>The Street Performers Atlas</b></u>
	<br><br>
	I used to commute to school every day from Washington Heights, all the way at the top of Manhattan. From 181st street until 125th street, I was often treated to an enthusiastic mariachi performance. 125th until 59th is break dance territory, where techno blasts from boom boxes and teenagers leap into the air for pocket change. From 59th all the way down to the Lower East Side, acoustic guitarists, solo singers and other talented (or less talented) folk enter the subway car, perform, ask for pocket change and move on to bring their music back Uptown. 
	<br><br>
	I propose an interactive subway map that highlights the most musical stops in Manhattan, color-coded by genre and peppered with interviews with three long-standing performers, each of whom I will shadow briefly. To limit the scope but still capture the spirit of Manhattan, this map would focus on the A train during weekday evening rush hour. The map will instantly show what sort of musical street performance you are most likely to encounter at each stop, and also allow an overarching comparison of street music genres up and down Manhattan.

	I will be using a mixture of official data sources from licensed street performers and observational data from a week of recording my actual experiences on the subway. The boots on the ground aspect will involve human sources, such as subway workers and fellow commuters, to develop a general impression. With complete data sets, I could pitch the story to a publication like the New York Times. With partial data sets (mainly interviews and subjective analyses) I could pitch this story to a less rigorous magazine.
